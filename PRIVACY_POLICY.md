## Introduction

Black Hole Simulation ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our macOS application.

## Local Data Storage

The application may create the following files on your device:

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the app's next version. The "Last Updated" date at the top indicates when this policy was last revised.
